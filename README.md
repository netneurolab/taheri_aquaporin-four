# Spatial organization of AQP4 channels in the human brain: links with perfusion, edema, and disease vulnerability

This repository contains code and data in support of "Spatial organization of AQP4 channels in the human brain: links with perfusion, edema, and disease vulnerability", available as a preprint on **[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.18.706679v1)**.

## overview
We map AQP4 gene expression across the human brain and relate this spatial organization to:
- vascular physiology (normative perfusion, vein density)
- neurodegenerative vulnerability (atrophy maps across diseases)
- peritumoral edema
